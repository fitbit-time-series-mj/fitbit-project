# Fitbit Data Time Series Project
The purpose of this project is to determine who an individual is, based on the data, as well as predicting three missing weeks in December. We use a variety of Time Series Analysis models to make the predictions including: Holt Linear Trend, Prophet, and Rolling Average. The jupyter notebook, `Fitbit_Time_Series_Project_Final.ipynb`, is the final project notebook. It contains the functions necessary to pulling the data as well as putting it together into a nice Pandas dataframe. We go through our different modeling steps as well as making predictions. A .csv file containing the predictions is included in the repo, and this is a [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lo-UaoLVkFrw8AhBeL0eqAY77dP0mLPUaT4X7jln8S8/edit?usp=sharing) to the presentation for the project.
